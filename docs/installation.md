# Installing Sycomore

## From source

Sycomore requires a C++11 compiler. To take full advantage of your CPU, [OpenMP](https://www.openmp.org/) is strongly recommended. If you want to validate your build of Sycomore, you should run the unit tests, which require [Boost.Test](https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/release/libs/test/). Sycomore uses [CMake](https://cmake.org/), so the simplest way to build it would be to create a `build` directory inside the source directory, run `cmake`, then run `make`:

```sh
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```

The compilation can take advantage of a multi-core CPU either by using [make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/) with the `-jN` flag (where `N` is the number of concurrent tasks, i.e. the number of cores) or by using [Ninja](https://ninja-build.org/). Once the compilation succeeds, the units tests can be run from the build directory:

```sh
export SYCOMORE_TEST_DATA=$(pwd)/../tests/data
ctest -T Test
```

This code benefits a lot of compilers optimization. It is recommended to build a `Release` version and use extra compiler flags to speed-up the simulations. Moreover, using OpenMP on macOS requires additional flags. Details of these flags on Linux and macOS are provided in the next sections.

### Debian

The following call to `apt-get` will install all dependencies:

```sh
apt-get install -y cmake g++ libboost-dev libboost-test-dev
```

When compiling with GCC on Debian 9, `-ffast-math` enables `-ffinite-math-only`, which breaks some parts of Sycomore (the application of a time interval with gradients or the computation of isochromat with off-resonance effects). All [other optimizations turned on by `-ffast-math`](https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc-8.2.0/gcc/Optimize-Options.html#index-ffast-math) can however be used and the recommended call to CMake is:

```sh
cmake \
  -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
  -DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS="-march=native -fno-math-errno -funsafe-math-optimizations -fno-rounding-math -fno-signaling-nans -fcx-limited-range -fexcess-precision=fast -D__FAST_MATH__" ‚Å†\
  ..
```

For more details on floating point math with GCC, refer to the [official documentation](https://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/FloatingPointMath).

### macOS with Homebrew

The following call to `brew` will install all dependencies:

```sh
brew install boost cmake libomp
```

The documentation of the [`-ffast-math` option in Clang](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/UsersManual.html#cmdoption-ffast-math) is rather terse, but the [source code](https://github.com/llvm-mirror/clang/blob/release_80/lib/Driver/ToolChains/Clang.cpp#L2278-L2288) provides more details. Despite disabling non-finite maths, using `-ffast-math` does not break Sycomore. With the extra flags required to detect OpenMP, the recommended call to CMake is:

```sh
OpenMP_FLAGS="-Xpreprocessor -fopenmp -I/usr/local/include"
cmake \
  -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
  -DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS="-march=native -ffast-math" \
  -DOpenMP_C_FLAGS="${OpenMP_FLAGS}" -DOpenMP_CXX_FLAGS="${OpenMP_FLAGS}" \
  -DOpenMP_C_LIB_NAMES="omp" -DOpenMP_CXX_LIB_NAMES="omp" \
  -DOpenMP_omp_LIBRARY=/usr/local/lib/libomp.dylib \
  ../
```
